======== FOREWORD & INTRODUCTION ========

This guide shall be your handbook in this God-forgotten superregion of this planet.
It is a collection of my personal experience and knowledge, historical facts and
common sense combined into one database of practically most things tha exist in
this place. I propose you use it not as a source of absolute truth(since experiences
are subjective and might be misleading in some way), but as a reference to look up
to and to form an objective view on anything you may encounter.

This handbook will be updated as history will march on. I also have in plan to write
a shellscript for this guide to make it interactive.

I hope this file will do well for your needs, whatever they may be. If you have any
additions, critiques, corrections or propositions to make - please do not hesitate to.
I will look into your proposal and, if it's objectively relevant and true to this
guide - I will include your work here and mention you as a  co-author. I wish this will
become a collaboratie effort of many people with different experiences and knowledge, so
it will be as accurate and objective as possible.

If you have any questions regarding this work that do not fit into any category listed
above or you just want to contact me, please do so via Telegram: @afterburnerpos.

Thank you for reading this part and stay safe.

==========================

======== LORE ========
======== HOW IT STARTED (1900-1991) ========

This section will not dig into deepest corners of this time period's history - instead
it will provide you with a list of events in chronological order with a short summary
depending on the type of event, i.e. if it's a military conflict, there will be information
about sides of the conflict, dates, casualties and a short summary of aftermath and impact
on the following events. All sources for information provided except obvious historical 
facts known to everyone(i.e. the date of October(Russian) Revolution) will be indexed. You
can find them at the end of this file.

======== HOW IT'S GOING (1991-present) ========

This section will look more in depth into this time period's events than the previous one,
It will be structured just the same, but will provide you with more detailed explanation of
what happened. Please note that the sources used in this section, especially for the most
recent events, may not be objective from the start, so please double-check all the sources
yourself. I actually encourage you to do so.

======== WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK (present-????) ========

This section will provide you with the list of most recent and current (2020-present)
events that had effect on post-Soviet space, short summary and confirmed consequences.
I prefer to not make any predictions here since I believe that they are subjective
enough to be deemed arguable and perhaps even controversial. I encourage you to form
your own point of view on events listed here and proceed accordingly. Just as in
previous section, but to even greater extent, I also encourage you to double-check all
sources of information in this one. I bet you know what a psyop is at this point.

======== END OF SECTION ========

======== GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS ========

This section will provide you with a list of guidelines, tips, facts and recommendations that
may help you to survive in this hellscape better. Please also take into account that some
or all of the information listed here is highly subjective - make your own ruleset and use
this one only as a reference. I will try to make it as structured as possible and place
everything in logical order.

> God, whichever one you believe in, will not help you here.

> Do not take part in any religious confrontation. If you encounter one, evade at all costs.
If you see that such conflict of any scale (from interpersonal to nation-wide) arising - do 
not try to intervene.

> Rain water in this region is mostly undrinkable, especially near large industrial centers
(i.e. Noril'sk, Temirtau, Zaporizhzhia). Do not drink without proper filtering.

> Tap water is mostly undrinkable as well. A well-known and relatively effective method to
filter tap water is following: firstly, get a aquaphor(graphine with a water filter).
Assemble it by simply inserting a filter in the socket. Then, pour the desired anount of
water in the top section. After some time, water will be filtered from heavy particles and
chemicals. At last, boil the filtered water. This will kill bacteria and get rid of some
remaining chemicals as well.
 
> Education system is fucked up beyond repair, starting from kindergarten. Do not even bother.

> Despite the line above, you still need a piece of paper to get a job that pays above lower
median/minimum wage.

> Corruption and lobbyism are perisitent on all levels of societal organizations. Do not try to
do anything about it. Everything here was decided before you were even born, no matter your age.

> In Russia, you get greater prison sentence for evading conscription than attempted murder.

> Ukraine, as of 2023, is the most mined country in the world.

> Under 99% of kitchen sinks there is a trash bin.

> 99% of trash disposal shafts in buildings are inoperable.

> "Perimeter" automatic nuclear detection and response system that covers all of the pos-Soviet
is not being properly maintained for over 30 years now. This can cause a malfunction and perhaps
a nuclear armageddon any second.

> As of epidemologic situation since 2020-present, try to avoid big crowds. Sanitary norms are
mostly nonexistant.

> Learn default codes for entrance door locks. Trust me, this will help you a lot.

> Pirating is illegal, but not prosecuted properly in all post-Soviet. Use it.

> Do not use or at least avoid as much as possible any government-owned IT products(i.e. social
networks). Use a secure connection when possible, preferrably always. 

> Majority of population in all countries is an inert, politically inactive mass, which consists
mostly of current ruling party hardliners/passive supporters. Legacy of the Soviet Union.

> List will be expanded.

======== END OF SECTION ========

======== REGIONS OVERVIEW ========

This section will provide you with a summary about all regions of the post-Soivet space.
Just for the sake of fun, I will rate them for their survivability and explain why.I will
use my own Hornet's Country Survivability index(HCSI), which is based on my own data and
experience. Since it is technically my personal opinion here, I will not include any sources
and highly encourage you to NOT take it as a factual representation. The scale ranges from
1.0 to 10.0, the last being the highest level possible.

======== RUSSIA ========

Capital: Moscow
Population(approx.): 140 million(2023)
Major ethnic group: Russians
HCSI: 3.5(2023), 5.5(2021)


Summary:
The largest country in post-Soviet space, as well as perhaps the most powerful in most ways.
That doesn't make it best though. A pretty ethnically diverse society and internal politics
vector maintained by technically one and only political party in Russia results in numerous
internal conflicts on ethnical, religious and national grounds. Overall, living in a population
centers with 1 million people or more can be considered as possible, but not recommended looking
back to last 5 years. Only exceptions may be Moscow and St. Petersburg, which are two biggest
cities in Russia - but that's why there is a saying "Moscow - is not Russia". External politics
vector of the current ruling party is relatively aggressive and is one of the key factors for
this country's current state.

======== UKRAINE ========

Capital: Kyiv
Popultaion(approx.): 40 million(2023)
Major ethnic group: Ukrainians
HSCI: 5.0(2023), 7.0(2021)

Summary:
Second largest former Soviet country by population and economic leftovers. Had nuclear weapons until
Budapest memorandum in 1997. Society, always being in some internal clusterfuck(i.e. right and left
shore dillema) is actually pretty united, as it appeared in 2022. Living is decent taking into
account the current war taking place, "before invasion" levels can be considered pleasant.
Population centers are a great option, however living in less populated cities can also be considered
possible, especially in the current state of things. External politics are pro-Western, largely
supported by the population.

======== BELARUS ========

Capital: Minsk
Population(approx.): 13 million(2023)
Major ethnic group: Belarus
HSCI: 6.5(2023), 7.5(2021)

Summary:
Was often called by people as "CIS's Switzerland", but not after 2022. Allegedly has Russian
nuclear weapons stationed on it's territory. Society is somehwat united, but has conflicts in some
questions(Russo-Ukrainian war, country's leadership, etc). Living is probably at the highest levels
among other options in post-Soviet, with only Baltic states being competitors. External politics are
fully pro-Russian, arguably supported by around 50% of the population.

======== KAZAKHSTAN ========

Capital: Astana
Population(approx.): 20 million
Major ethnic group: Kazakh
HSCI: 5.0(2023), 5.5(2021)

Summary:
The second largest country in the post-Soviet. Also had nuclear weapons before passing them to Russia.
Society is more than united, even taking into account the ethnical diversity, however some deeply rooted
intranational conflicts withing Kazakh ethnic group can be present. Living levels have slightly decreased
due to current geopolitical and economic situation. Living is possible only in cities with population
above 50000 people - smaller ones are an absolute no-go. The best option is oblast' centers, Almaty and
Karagandy being arguably the best options. External politics are balanced between Russia and West,
and this course is supported by the majority of population.

======== SOUTHERN CENTRAL ASIA ========

Countries: Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikstan
Capitals: Tashkent, Ashhabad, Bishkek, Dushanbe
Population(approx.): 130 million
Major ethnic groups: Uzbek, Turkmen, Kyrgyz, Tajik
HSCI: N/A

Summary:
A big chunk of post-Soviet space containing 4 former Soviet countries. Society's status is unknown to
author, however some information about internal and external conflicts taking place in the region is
present. Living is possible only in large population centers, preferrably capitals. Rural areas are
literally disconnected from the world in most aspects. External politics of the countries are ranging
widely, from Uzbekistan being mostly pro-Western and Tajikstan being clearly pro-Russian.

======== CAUCASUS REGION ========

Countries: Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan
Capitals: Tbilisi, Erevan, Baku
Population(approx.): 15 million
Major ethnics groups: Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani
HSCI: 6.0(2023), 6.0(2021)

Summary:
Caucasus region is containing three former Soviet countries. Georgian's society is very diverse in
terms of politics, and Armenian and Azerbaijani ones are being mostly hostile to each other, uniting
them in that matter. Living can be considered good, especially in capitals. Rural areas do not differ
much from the rest of post-Soviet. External politics also are diverse, withGeorgia being fully
pro-West, Armenia being somewhere in the middle, and Azzerbaijan being... pro-Turkish, yeah.

======== BALTIC REGION ========

Countries: Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia
Capitals: Riga, Vilnus, Tallin
Population(approx.): 10 million
Major ethnics group: Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian
HSCI: 9.0(2023), 9.0(2021)

Summary:
Perhaps the best place to live in the post-Soviet space overall. Society is mostly united, as it is known
to me. Living is definitely pleasant in any city, town or village, with perhaps rare exceptions.
External politics are clearly pro-West - let's say all these countries are in NATO, alright?
Generally speaking - the best you can get here.

======== MOLDOVA ========

Capital: Kishinev
Population(approx.): 4 million
Major ethnics group: Moldovans
HSCI: N/A

Summary:
[INSUFFICIENT DATA]

======== END OF SECTION ========

======== SPECIES ========
======== HOMO SAPIENS ========

This section will provide you with knowledge of the most local specimen you can encounter,
classified on many criterias, such as natural habitat, ethnic and political allegiance and
observed behaviour. Recommendations and guidelines are also included. All species are also
divided to "human" and "non-human" cathegories, based on their perception of basic human
needs, rights and basic facts. There is no actual order of them in this list, it is just a
collection of knowledge expanding as new information appears.

======== HUMAN ========

=======================

Name: Rabotyaga(also known as: Muzhik, Grechneviy Muzhik, Zavodchanin)
Age: 16-65+
Gender: Male, but some female species have been observed
Average behaviour: indifferent or friendly in most cases, though some cases of hostilities
have been recorded
Common habitat: almost everywhere, especially industrial facilities and sometimes bars

Description:
The word "rabotyaga" is a slang variation of the Russian word "rabotnik" - worker. Rabotyaga
is often a person who works a heavy job, like industrial, construction, logistics, etc.
These people are rarely hostile, so it is safe to approach and interact with them most of the
time. Most of them do have higher than average technical expertise and muscle mass, which is
a byproduct of their occupation. Depending on age, some notable characteristics may differ, but
the most common ones are: smoker, alcohol consuming, extensive use of explicit vocabulary, high
technical proficiency, rough skin, dark rings under eyes, marks that indicate their occupation
(i.e. for painters or electricians on factories, a distinct smell of acetone/paint/soldering flux
is perisistent, for metalworkers - burned dot marks on their skin from sparks, etc.)

=======================

Name: Gopnik(also known as: Marginal, Bydlo, Gopota)
Age: 12-30+
Gender: Mostly male, can be female as well
Average behaviour: passive-aggressive or hostile
Common habitat: low income neighbourhoods, liquor stores, playgrounds, small alleys

Description:
Perhaps the most known type of people whose name became a buzzword known arcoss the entire world.
The word "gopnik" is a derivative from word "gop" or "gop-stop", which means on marginal language
to take away by force, or simply rob. These people are mostly hostile, especially when drunk, though
some are switching to the passive-aggressive or even defensive behviour if they encounter a threat
that's bigger than them. Actively avoid. This type of Homo Sapiens species is included in "human"
sections, since most of them still do abide by some kind of code - the "vorovskoy zakon", or
"robber's law", which is a form of marginal unwritten Bible followed by many. Distinctive flags are:
smoking, drinking in public, cheap sportswear(the notorious Adidas tracksuit variations) or "classy"
look, usage of ONLY explicit vocabulary and marginal jargon(prison talk), usually in a company of
similar individuals, sometimes wearing many rings and/or an Orthodox Christian cross on the neck,
prison- or marginal-themed tattooes.

=======================

Name: Ment(also known as Musor, Pharaon, Legaviy)
Age: 22-55+
Gender: Male, no female versions observed yet, though the possibility exists
Average behaviour: deceiving, passive-aggressive, sometimes hostile
Common habitat: streets, police departments, public places, technically anywhere

Description:
"Ment" is a marginal jargon word for a policeman, which found an extensive use in the last 30 years
among general population for the same meaning. The word itself implies the negative attitude to a
law enforcement serviceman, thus is not tolerated by the mentioned before. Basically, just a police
officer, but as the corruption and lobbyism is perisistent on all levels of society, most of them
have truly earned this name through years. Do not actively avoid, but try to not intersect with them
if you can. Distinctive characteristics are: the uniform, obviously, sometimes a service weapon in a
hip holster(most common: PM/Makarov), sometimes narcissistic attitude towards others.

=======================

Name: Bomzh(also known as Bich, Bomzhara)
Age: technically any, usually 40-60+
Gender: Both male and female
Average behaviour: indifferent, passive aggressive or hostile
Common habitat: virtually anywhere, dumpsters, abandoned buildings, streets

Description:
The word "BOMZh" originally is an abbreviation from "Bez Opredelennogo Mesta Zhitel'stva", which is
"without a definitive living place". Simply put - a homeless person, often marginalized. Actively avoid.
May be aggressive, but cases of friendly behaviour are not uncommon, mostly to deceive a person for
financial profit. Distinctive characteristics: awful smell, drunken breath, beaten-up clothes, dirty,
extensive use of explicit vocabulary.

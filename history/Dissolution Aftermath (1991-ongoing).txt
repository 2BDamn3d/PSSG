USSR de jure ceases to exist according to the Belovezha Accords, the original of those the Belorussians have successfully lost (https://web.archive.org/web/20131113230810/http://news.mail.ru/politics/11898413/?frommail=1), but de facto it has stopped existing after the Ukrainian referendum about independence. the Belovezha trio were now confronted with a fact: Kravchuk will not sign the treaty about the new union.

Anarchy and lawlessness ensues in the vast majority of the ex-USSR countries and are embroiled in civil wars on national grounds:
- Ossetians vs Georgians (1991-1992)
- Georgians vs Georgians (1991-1993)
- Armenians vs Azerbaijanis (1991-1994)
- Abkhazians vs Georgians (1992-1993)
- Ossetians vs Ingush (1992)
- Moldavians vs Transnistrians (Moldavians + Russians + Ukrainians) (1992)
- Tajiks vs Tajiks (1992-1997)
- Chechens vs Central Power (de jure: 1994-1996, de facto: ongoing since 1990)

The patriot games left a trail of corpses and tortured people in their wake, which hits the already depopulating regions very, very hard.
